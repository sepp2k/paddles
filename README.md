Paddles!
========

Description
------------

Paddles! is an old two-player PONG clone that I created with Qt back in 2009.
Its most (as in only) notable feature is that it displays a background picture.

The current background image is ["Sunrise in PÃ¤rnu river, Estonia"][1] by Aiver
Oja, licensed under [CC BY-SA 3.0 EE][2].

Compile and Run
---------------

    qmake
    make
    ./paddles

Controls
--------

The left paddle is controlled with 'w' and 's', the right paddle with the up and
down arrows or 8 and 2 on the numpad.
